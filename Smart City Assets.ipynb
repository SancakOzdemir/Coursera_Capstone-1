How governments can innovate may often depend on its physical assets\u2014 places of recreation, nature, entertainment, eateries, transportation hubs, and so on. Some governments have access to a greater number and diversity of assets than others, which impacts what they can do to become more liveable, loveable, and smarter cities. For example, coffee shops oftentimes are a source of paid, sponsored, or free Wi-Fi. The lack of coffee shops may therefore indicate that a city government should direct funding and attention to establishing public Wi-Fi networks.\n\nAs a small contribution to the smart city discourse, I will venture to shed light on the combination and scale of assets required to scale up smart city initiatives and programmes. Possible insights may include: which cities have the greatest potential to scale up smart city initiatives by virtue of their combined assets; what are the various pathways to becoming a smart city; which type of assets contribute most to the development of a strong smart city; and so on. City governments can then devise effective mechanisms to stimulate the creation of meaningful assets, in the form of grants, incentives, regulation, programs, platforms, and exchanges.",

            "source": "## Data\n[Eden Strategy Institute](https://www.edenstrategyinstitute.com) ranked Smart City governments in their [Top 50 Smart City Governments](https://www.smartcitygovt.com/) report, which assessed readiness based on such government features as vision, organizational structure, budget, and so on. From these features, over 140 cities were ranked, of which the top 50 received a closer investigation of their innerworkings.\n\nWith this as a backdrop, I will be using data obtained via Foursquare as my primary source of differentiating the assets between cities. As Foursquare is most popular in the United States, I will focus my modelling on the U.S. cities that were ranked. Thus the U.S. cities that will be compared are:\n\n* New York\n* Boston\n* San Francisco\n* Chicago\n* Seattle\n* Charlotte\n* Washington D.C.\n* Columbus\n* Los Angeles\n* Atlanta\n* Kansas City\n* Philadelphia\n* Baltimore\n* Dallas\n* Houston\n* Miami\n* Phoenix\n* Portland\n* San Antonio\n\n### Foursquare dataset\nThe Foursquare data itself will comprise a diversity of venues such as those mentioned as physical assets in the Introduction, including the venue name, venue category, average ratings, and location.\n\n### Other datasets\nOther data will include city population, density, and economy size.\n* http://worldpopulationreview.com/us-cities/\n* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._metropolitan_areas_by_GDP\n\nPopulation and density will help us place the number and quality of venues into perspective; the number of venues in New York to that of Columbus would not be a good comparison, for example. Hence, we must understand the coverage and saturation of venues in relation to the populations they serve.\n\nEconomy size has a similar role as population and density, in terms of gaining insight into the kinds of venues available given the resources available to the city. For example, a less economically prosperous city may have more parks than a more prosperous city all other factors held constant.",
